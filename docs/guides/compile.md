# How to compile this tool

To compile this tool you need to have [Haxe](https://haxe.org).

clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Slushi-Github/HaxeNXCompiler.git
```

You need hxcpp (You can also use hxcpp-nx, but it's not worth it.):

```bash
haxelib install hxcpp
```

Then you can compile this tool:

```bash
haxe build.hxml
```

The executable will be in the ``export`` folder!
